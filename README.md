# BeautyDetector
It is an old kaggle notebook of mine.

# Idea
I was wondering, if a CNN image classifier is able to classify "beauty".
Of course beauty is subjective. I only tried to train a classifier which is able to 
detect the concept of "beautiful woman" based on google search.

# Dataset
I created one set of images for typing "beautiful women" and another set of images for "ugly women".

# Result
Model accuracy was about 90% which is pretty good.
